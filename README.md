# Description
You've decided to treat yourself to a long holiday vacation in Honolulu, Hawaii. To help with your trip planning, you decide to do a climate analysis about the area. You will analyse the precipitation and temperature in Hawaii before designing a Climate App using Flask API to create routes based on the analysis.

# SurfsUp Directory
Refer to app.py within the directory for the precipitation and temperature analysis.
Refer to climate_starter.ipynb within the directory for the Flask API routes

# Code Source
        precip = {date: prcp for date, prcp in PY_prcp}

The above code was provided as guidance from the bootcamp tutor and was used in the app.py file to loop and pair date and prcp values within a given timeframe, and store it within a dictionary.
